# Privacy Policy

Effective date: February 2, 2026

VeloRead ("the app") is provided by Babatunde Adeola.

## Summary

- VeloRead does not run a developer-controlled backend.
- Imported books, reading progress, and settings are stored locally on your device.
- VeloRead does not sell your personal information.

## Information We Process

VeloRead processes the following data on your device:

- Imported document content (for example `.txt` and `.epub` files you choose)
- Reading state and app preferences (for example WPM, ORP settings, progress)

This data is used only to provide app features and is stored locally using on-device storage.

## Information We Collect

VeloRead does not intentionally collect personal data to developer-controlled servers.

## Third-Party Services and Platforms

Your device platform or app marketplace provider (for example Apple App Store or Google Play) may collect technical or diagnostic information under their own policies. VeloRead does not control those providers.

If future versions of VeloRead add analytics, crash reporting, sync, or account features, this policy will be updated before rollout.

## Data Retention and Deletion

- Data remains on your device until you remove books in the app or uninstall the app.
- Deleting a book in VeloRead removes that book and its local progress from app storage.
- Uninstalling VeloRead removes local app data based on platform behavior.

## Children's Privacy

VeloRead is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Security

VeloRead relies on platform-provided app sandboxing and local storage protections. No method of storage is guaranteed to be 100% secure.

## International Users

Because VeloRead stores data locally and does not operate a backend, international transfers by the developer are not part of normal app operation.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the effective date above.
